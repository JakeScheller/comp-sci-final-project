# AP Computer Science final project
This is a card game I wrote for my final project in AP Computer Science in high school. It's kind of a weird terminal-based multiplayer game inspired by RPGs. Players draw cards, and each suit grants certain stat or attack/defence bonuses. Players take turns drawing cards or using cards to attack other players until there's only one player left. Games tend to last a really long time, in my experience.

I wrote it in Python first and then translated it to Java. I think the Python version works right, but I'm not sure about the Java verison.
